# Speaker_GPT_Follower

## Project Overview
This project seeks to assess how OpenAI's GPT models can enhance navigation instructions created by the "Speaker Follower Models for Vision and Language Navigation." By experimenting with prompts and models the focus is on determining whether GPT can improve the quality of these instructions and, consequently, assess its impact on the performance of follower models within Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) scenarios.
## Features
- **Instruction Refinement**: Using OpenAI's GPT models to enhance navigation instructions from the speaker model for clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Parallel Processing**: Implementing multithreading for refinement processes ensuring effective handling of large instruction sets.
- **Navigation Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the follower model's performance using both the original and GPT-refined instructions to determine the impact of instruction refinement on navigation accuracy in VLN scenarios.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implements robust error handling and detailed logging to monitor the refinement process and ensure data integrity.

## Usage
This project involves a series of steps where initial instructions are generated by the speaker model, refined using GPT, and evaluated using the follower model. The main script manages the process based on GPT and is adaptable for testing various GPT models and prompts.
