# Speaker_GPT_Follower

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore how the GPT models developed by OpenAI can enhance navigation instructions that are generated by the "Speaker Follower Models for Vision and Language Navigation." The focus is on experimenting with prompts and models to determine if the use of GPT can improve the quality of these instructions. Additionally, the project aims to evaluate how this enhancement impacts the performance of follower 
models in Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) scenarios.

## Scripts and Dataset

The main components of this project, which consist of the scripts created to improve instructions through GPT models, can be found in the tasks/R2R folder. Therefore, only this specific directory has been included in the code submission. You can locate a link to the repository at the end of this document. These scripts play a role in creating and perfecting navigation instructions, forming the foundation of how the project operates.

### Script Location

- **Directory Path**: `tasks/R2R`
  -  Within this directory are all the scripts utilised to enhance navigation instructions. It serves as the central storage location for the project's code related to integrating Speaker-Follower models and refining instruction processes.

### Dataset

- **Dataset File**: `tasks/R2R/data/R2R_GPT_enhanced_speaker_data_paths.json`
  -  The dataset generated by these scripts is essential for comprehending the improvements made to navigation instructions. It captures the results of using GPT models to fine-tune output from the speaker model, providing a picture of how this project impacts navigation accuracy in VLN scenarios.

## Features
- **Instruction Refinement**: Using OpenAI's GPT models to refine navigation instructions from the speaker model for clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Parallel Processing**: Implementing multithreading for refinement processes ensuring effective handling of large instruction sets.
- **Navigation Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the follower model's performance using both the original and GPT-refined instructions to determine the impact of instruction refinement on navigation accuracy in VLN scenarios.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Establishing robust error handling mechanisms and detailed logging procedures to monitor the refinement process and maintain data integrity.

## Usage
This project involves a series of steps where initial instructions are generated by the speaker model, refined using GPT, and evaluated using the follower model. The main script manages the process based on GPT and is adaptable for testing various GPT models and prompts.
